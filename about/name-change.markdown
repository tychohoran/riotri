<h1>Name Change: Girls Rock! RI to RIOT RI</h1>

<h2>WHY</h2>
 
In its mission, Girls Rock! Rhode Island (GRR!) made a commitment to help foster the development of healthy identities of girls, women, trans and non-binary individuals. It has become apparent that the very name under which the organization functions is no longer empowering to our LGBTQ participants, staff, and volunteers.
 
When the name of GRR! was originally imagined 10 years ago, the word “Girl” carried very different connotations than it does now. When the organization was formed in 2009, the Riot Grrl movement of the 1990s and early ‘00s still carried weight in the cultural zeitgeist as a symbol of inclusive, underground feminism in the music scene. As language has evolved and expanded over the past decade, that word “Girl” as it appears in our name now means something very different.


<h2>WHY NOW</h2>

Over the course of the past two years, GRR! began to focus on internal anti-oppression practices. With support from the Equity Action Fund, GRR! now has the opportunity to make profound and sustaining change to the organization.

Based on data from 2018, 40% of our volunteer base identifies as LGBTQ. 16% of our middle school participants and 23% of our high school participants identify as LGBTQ as well. According to PEW Research Center data, the median age for LGBT individuals to come out is 20 years old, so we can safely predict this number to be underreported.  The YRBS reports that 8% of high school age youth identify as LGBTQ—that number is nearly tripled in attendees of GRR!’s high school camp. With this in mind, GRR! has a responsibility to be a leader in organizational inclusivity.

2019-2020 has been a year of transition – new leadership, new space, and even some new programs. It’s important to know, however, that this name change has been in the works since well before it became publicly visible. For years we have been saying “We’re not just for girls, and we don’t just play rock!” If you have to specify that every time you say it, something isn’t working.  

<h2>HOW DID YOU CHOOSE THE NEW NAME</h2>

Conversations around changing the name have been circulating for many years, but the process officially started in January 2019, when the organization began to seek funding to support the switch. The organization was granted support by the Equity Action Fund, which allowed the organization to, fittingly, take action towards organizational equity. 

In April 2019, the organization began a strategic planning process which highlighted the importance of inclusivity and accessibility as a main pillar. The strategic planning process continued into early 2020, and informed decision making about the new name. 

In September 2019, the organization released a community survey, gathering information about what the new name should include in order to reflect its current participants and stakeholders. 


With the survey results as the north star, the Board of Directors began brainstorming names. In November, the organization passed all of the information it had garnered to the youth advisory board. The youth were asked to make a final decision about the new name, guided by the community survey, and Board guidelines. The youth chose a name by December 29th 2019, and it was officially released to the public on December 31 2019. 

In December 2019, the organization also chose to hire a new logo designer to reflect the new name. After reviewing the work of hundreds of illustrations, the organization elected to hire Melita Tirado to design the new brand. 

From January to April, the organization has worked with Mx. Tirado to finalize the logo, branding, and assets. The official name and logo, along with the new website and social media handles will be released on March 30, 2020. 

<h2>WHAT DOES IT MEAN</h2>

RIOT RI stands for Revolution in our Times Rhode Island. By keeping the word RIOT in the name, the organization nods to the roots of Girls Rock! Rhode Island, which was grown from the Riot Grrl movement. The full name nods to the social justice oriented mission of the organization, and the organization's commitment to challenge power structures along with empowering individuals. 

<h2>Quotes from our Youth Advisory Board About the New Name:</h2>

“The organization is part of a bigger community. It’s like when a friend comes out and you have to use new pronouns, at first it can be difficult but you just have to keep doing it and it [becomes] normal cause you care about them”

“It’s a positive thing, this is still a space for everyone and now it’s broader space where everyone can feel comfortable, even if you don’t feel comfortable with the label of girl.” 
 
“I love it, one summer my mom signed up for camp and I didn’t wanna go because I don’t want to be identified as a girl, so the name change made me feel really happy.”

“This organization isn’t to single out just girls but all folks who have not been supported in the music industry... that goes far beyond girls.”
