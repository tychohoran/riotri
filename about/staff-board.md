## Lipou Laliemthavisay

Lipou [lee-pu, she/her/hers] was born and raised in Providence, RI. While growing up, she always thought she would be an ambassador and allow all visa applications that came in. However, life took a different path. Coming from an immigrant family, she had a deep desire to work with and for marginalized communities, which then grew into a passion for indigent defense. Aside from being a public defender, she is a proud parent of two pitbulls, Kenya & Penny, and teaches criminal law & procedure part-time. She loves going on walks/hikes with the dogs and listening to music to de-stress. She is glad she was invited to join the board in December 2018, though regretful she did not join the organization sooner. She recently began taking virtual drum classes @  RIOT and looks forward to bangin' out Rage Against the Machine's Bulls on Parade!

## Reba Mitchell

Reba Mitchell is a current board member who has volunteered since 2009 as a vocal instructor, band coach, workshop leader, and GRIT coordinator. She spends most of her time in a 3x5 iso booth as an audiobook narrator (having recorded over 200 titles and receiving a coveted Earphones Award), and, in order to escape the box and remain part of society, at Flipp Salon as a hairdresser. She holds degrees in Women's Studies and Cosmetology. Yes, her hairstyle is specifically engineered to accommodate wearing headphones six hour a day.

## Abeer Khatana

Abeer Khatana (she/her) joined the RIOT RI board in 2019 and currently serves as the chair of the Anti-Oppression Committee. She has volunteered as a workshop facilitator and has been a (very enthusiastic!!!) participant in RIOT RI's drum lessons for beginners. She has a background in community organizing, development, facilitation, and policy analysis. Abeer is deeply committed to genuine, intentional relationship building. Her superpower is connecting every conversation to the evils of capitalism.

## Aloe Russell

Aloe (she/her) has been working with RIOT! RI since 2016, first as a volunteer and then also teaching lessons. She's a musician, music teacher, community college student, and she does IT for AS220. Aloe is new to the board in 2020 and super psyched about deepening her relationship with this awesome organization!


## Yasmine Hassan

Yasmine Hassan [she/her] is an interdisciplinary artist (mechanical engineer by training, youth design/build educator by trade, musician by passion) who has lived in Providence since 2013, despite spending her childhood calling many different places home. Though she was born in Brooklyn, NY, she spent years of her childhood just outside of Philadelphia and Richmond, VA, before her family eventually settled in Columbus, OH. Having grown up visiting family in Pawtucket, though, she was no stranger to Rhode Island when she moved here for undergrad. She comes from a working-class, "tri-cultural" household of African & Arab immigrants--her father is Sudanese and her mother is Sierra Leonean-born Lebanese. Her values and teaching practice are deeply informed by this identity and upbringing, but she also draws inspiration from a fascination with music of ALL sorts, Black pop culture history, cartoons and anime, old Nintendo games, magical realism, and a fiercely DIY work ethic. She's been involved with RIOT since 2018 as an Adult Rock Camp participant, through drum and bass individual lessons, and through her full-time job at a nearby peer youth arts nonprofit

# YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD

![LYLAC.jpg](/uploads/LYLAC.jpg)

## LYLAC

The Loud Youth Leadership Advisory Council is a youth-led council formed to amplify the voices of young people within RIOT RI. As a youth-serving organization, RIOT RI recognizes the importance in having the input of the young people we serve.

We believe in supporting the creation of leadership opportunities for girls, trans and nonbinary youth in our community. The goal of the youth advisory board is for its members to collaborate with each other, as well as staff and board, to acquire leadership skills and to have a space where they can express themselves affecting change within the organization and their community.

Passing the mic to youth leaders allows RIOT RI to have a relevant perspective of the issues affecting the young people we serve through our programs and work as a collective to come up with innovative ideas.

The 5 key components of the youth advisory board: youth-led,  consistent engagement, community agreements, creating a space for youth where youth can be themselves, taking active part in different organizational projects.

LYLAC meets once every other week and their involvement has been key in moving the organization forward by taking part in different project such as:

* New Name Initiative
* Program Empowerment Evaluations
* Rethinking Leadership
* Curriculum Evaluation
* Community Engagement
