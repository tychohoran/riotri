## Lipou Laliemthavisay

Lipou [lee-pu, she/her/hers] was born and raised in Providence, RI. While growing up, she always thought she would be an ambassador and allow all visa applications that came in. However, life took a different path. Coming from an immigrant family, she had a deep desire to work with and for marginalized communities, which then grew into a passion for indigent defense. Aside from being a public defender, she is a proud parent of two pitbulls, Kenya & Penny, and teaches criminal law & procedure part-time. She loves going on walks/hikes with the dogs and listening to music to de-stress. She is glad she was invited to join the board in December 2018, though regretful she did not join the organization sooner. She recently began taking virtual drum classes @  RIOT and looks forward to bangin' out Rage Against the Machine's Bulls on Parade!

# YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD

![LYLAC.jpg](/uploads/LYLAC.jpg)

## LYLAC

The Loud Youth Leadership Advisory Council is a youth-led council formed to amplify the voices of young people within RIOT RI. As a youth-serving organization, RIOT RI recognizes the importance in having the input of the young people we serve.

We believe in supporting the creation of leadership opportunities for girls, trans and nonbinary youth in our community. The goal of the youth advisory board is for its members to collaborate with each other, as well as staff and board, to acquire leadership skills and to have a space where they can express themselves affecting change within the organization and their community.

Passing the mic to youth leaders allows RIOT RI to have a relevant perspective of the issues affecting the young people we serve through our programs and work as a collective to come up with innovative ideas.

The 5 key components of the youth advisory board: youth-led,  consistent engagement, community agreements, creating a space for youth where youth can be themselves, taking active part in different organizational projects.

LYLAC meets once every other week and their involvement has been key in moving the organization forward by taking part in different project such as:

* New Name Initiative
* Program Empowerment Evaluations
* Rethinking Leadership
* Curriculum Evaluation
* Community Engagement
