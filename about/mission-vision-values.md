# MISSION
RIOT RI is a volunteer-based non-profit that uses music creation, critical thinking and collaborative relationships to foster collective empowerment and the development of healthy identities in girls, women, trans, and gender-expansive youth and adults.

# VISION
We start from a basis of mutual respect. We envision a world in which our identities are assets, not limitations, and where we are able to actively claim and develop our own strengths and expertise to create a world of our own design.

# VALUES

## Music as a Force for Change
We focus on music’s ability to mobilize, unify, and invigorate people to create social change.  Music is a powerful tool that connects individual expression to collective thoughts, emotions, and actions.  Creating music within a band requires not only collaboration, respect, and support, but also individual effort, skill building, and expression.  Our goal is to use music’s unifying force to empower individuals and communities to band together and create positive change for themselves and for society as a whole.

## Respect and Communication
We start from a basis of mutual respect. Each individual’s unique qualities and perspectives are valuable and shape our community.  We also recognize that our experiences and perspectives may differ and we believe that open dialogue and direct communication can lead us to common ground and deeper collaboration and a stronger community. 

## Analyzing Power
We encourage critical analysis of intersecting systems of oppression, particularly when manifested in media, popular culture and our day to day lives. Creating this dialogue provides us with the tools we need to take positive action against these systems.

## Fighting Gender-Based Oppression
We support cis and trans women and girls, non binary and gender non-conforming individuals. We also explicitly support trans men and transmasculine individuals. We reject a culture that values individuals for their appearance and sexuality rather than their character, we all need support to create a strong sense of identity and self.  We are committed to expanding traditional conceptions of and conversations about gender.  

## Collaboration
We believe in a do-it-yourself spirit that empowers individuals to act and create on their own and we also recognize that we are stronger together.  A collective process of creation and self-expression develops individual and community resilience. We share skills and learn from each other in a supportive environment in which experimentation, critical engagement, and feedback are valued.

## Learning and Leading
We encourage learning and leadership at all levels:  program participants, volunteers, board and staff.  We strive to listen to each other openly and actively to make intentional decisions together.
