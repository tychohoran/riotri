The RIOT Music Mentorship Program will kick off as a virtual one on one offering but our goal is to have you back in the RIOT space (indoors or outdoors) as soon as it is safe and viable to do so, because it's your space, we just help run it!

Similar to our Band Booster Program, you will have the ability to meet with and trusted adult who will be there to support your musical process and anything else along the way. 

It's a choose your own adventure mentorship where you get to say what you want to focus and what you want to get out of the program. Participants will have the opportunity to participate in our end of the season event with a live performance with support from their mentor along the way!

## What can my mentor help with?

* Got a song you're working on and would like some feedback? 
* Need help with learning how to record?
* Want to know how to upload your music online and build a social media presence? 
* School stressing you out and need a listening ear?
* Wanna spend an hour practicing your instrument being joined by your mentor? 
* Want to learn how to write a song? 
* Want to design a logo and learn how to make merch for your band? 
* Want to learn how to set up a drum kit or a PA?  
* Have a job interview you want to practice for? 
* Have questions about gender, body image, or other aspects of being a girl, trans or binary youth? 
* Want to learn what it's like to be a professional musician and how to become one yourself?
* Your mentorship can be anything you want it to be! We'll hear what you need, and match you accordingly!
