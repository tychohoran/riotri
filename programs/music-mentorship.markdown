Similar to our Band Booster Program, you will have the ability to meet with and trusted adult who will be there to support your musical process and anything else along the way. 

It's a choose your own adventure mentorship where you get to say what you want to focus and what you want to get out of the program. Participants will have the opportunity to take part in our end of the season event with a live performance with support from their mentor along the way!

Registration opens 1/22/21 and ends 2/24/21. Mentees will be selected by 3/1/2021.

## Instruction during the Pandemic

The RIOT Music Mentorship Program will kick off as a virtual one on one offering but our goal is to have you back in the RIOT space (indoors or outdoors) as soon as it is safe and viable to do so, because it's your space, we just help run it!

In the meantime, all mentorship will take place via Zoom until the vaccine is widespread and the spread of COVID-19 is under control.
