Youth Drop in takes place from 3:00 - 6:00 PM on Monday and Wednesday afternoons starting on March 16th, 2022!

Want to try jamming out on the drums without the structure of a lesson? Want to play around with a guitar since you don't have one at home? Want to come in, have some chips, and talk about how wild your day was with some likeminded peers and adults? 

No expectations, just free space for you to hang out and jam out. 

Come in to 763R Westminster St (behind Nice Slice!) after school for RIOT RI's new Youth Drop In! 

Preregistration is required for each week to make sure covid vaccination is registered in our system--sign up in advance, or try your luck at the door (but remember to bring your vax card!)
