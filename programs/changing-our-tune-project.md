Bystander Training: Dates TBA, Sumer 2020

In 2019, RIOT RI recieved funding from the Women’s Fund of Rhode Island to undertake the Changing Our Tune project!
 
Using the Green Dot Program, RIOT works with venue owners, bookers, and staff, along with bands and audience members to mitigate sexual harassment in the Providence Music Industry.
 
Through cohort conversations, and bystander training, RIOT has begun the work of preventing harasment in our local venues from the root. RIOT will publish a list of approved, trained venues on a website which you will be able to find at Changingourtune.org, along with a summary of the data found through our community survey. 
 
This year, our partner venues are: AS220, Columbus Theatre, The Public, Goodwill Engine Co, Askew, and the News Cafe. 

We are current;y seeking participant venues for next year’s cohort. If you are a venue owner/staff member, and your are intersted in being contacted about this project, a form will be available for you to apply in Summer 2020. 
 
Bystander Trainings will be held for venue owners and staff, and the public at large over the summer, dates TBA.
