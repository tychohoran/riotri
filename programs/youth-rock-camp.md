## WHAT IS YOUTH ROCK CAMP?
Youth Rock Camp (previously called Girls Rock Camp) is an intensive one-week day camp offered to youth ages 10-18, where campers of all skill levels have the opportunity to learn guitar, bass, drums, vocals, or other instruments. Campers will also form a band, write an original song, and perform at the final Showcase for friends, family, and fans!

In addition to all this, campers will have the opportunity to meet other girls, trans and nonbinary youth, musicians, and mentors, and participate in enrichment activities such as workshops on media literacy or screen-printing. GRR! welcomes campers that identify as female, trans, and gender expansive.

## LESSONS

Participants choose one instrument to focus on for the week–drums, bass, guitar, vocals, or keyboards. All instruction happens in small group lessons and is led by experienced and enthusiastic women musicians.

## BAND PRACTICE

On the first day, everyone forms bands in a way that is fun, not scary. The bands have band practice every day. During band practice, band members work together to write a song, and practice playing as an ensemble. Band coaches help bands with the writing process, facilitate the rehearsals, and answer questions as necessary. Band counselors help guide campers and help with any bumps along the way.

## WORKSHOPS

Throughout the weekend, workshops are held on a variety of interesting, helpful, and fun topics!  Some workshops we’ve had in the past include: Songwriting; Relational Aggression (Bullying); Screenprinting & Band Art; Image & Identity; Performance Anxiety & Body Confidence; Media Literacy; Self-Defense; and Zine-making.

## LUNCHTIME PERFORMANCES

Each day, one to two visiting artist/bands play a live set, then they stick around to take questions from the group. Past performers have included: Roz Raskin & the Ricecakes; Becky Bass; FINE.; Scarce; 5th Elament; Arch Cape; Malportado Kids; and more!

## FINAL SHOWCASE

At the end of the camp week, camper bands perform their original songs at a showcase concert for friends, family, and fans.
