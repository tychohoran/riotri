## WHAT IS ADULT ROCK CAMP AND WHY?
Adult Rock Camp (ARC) is a weekend day camp in Pawtucket, RI that provides an opportunity for women, trans, and gender-expansive individuals 18+ to let loose for a long weekend and play music together. It is an intensive, three-day music and mentoring program created to give adults an experience similar to our [Youth Rock Camp](/programs/youth-rock-camp.html). This “grown-up” version of camp brings together folks from different walks of life and all levels of musical experience for a long weekend of instrument lessons, songwriting, band practice, and workshops, all culminating in a showcase concert at a professional music venue. ***NO PRIOR MUSICAL EXPERIENCE IS NECESSARY!!***

## REGISTRATION and PAYMENT
Next Adult Rock Camp is Friday, January 31 - Sunday, February 2! Capacity is limited to the first 30 participants. Flexible payment plans are available and a limited number of need-based scholarships are available on a first-come, first served basis for those who qualify.

## LESSONS
Participants choose one instrument to focus on for the weekend–drums, bass, guitar, vocals, or keyboards. All instruction happens in small group lessons and is led by experienced and enthusiastic women, trans, or gender-expansive musicians.

## BAND PRACTICE
On the first day, everyone forms bands in a way that is fun, not scary. The bands have band practice every day. During band practice, band members work together to write a song, and practice playing as an ensemble. Band coaches help bands with the writing process, facilitate the rehearsals, and answer questions as necessary.

## WORKSHOPS
Throughout the weekend, workshops are held on a variety of topics, from Screen printing/Making Band Art to Songwriting (it’s not as hard as you might think)! Other topics may include: Queer Rock History, Relational Aggression, Yoga, Kickboxing, and many others. The camp day is also interspersed with fun stuff, from warm-up games to making buttons with your band name.

## LUNCHTIME PERFORMANCES
Each day, one to two visiting artist/bands play a live set, then they stick around to take questions from the group. Past performers have included national acts like Mary Lou Lord, prominent local musicians such as Roz and the Ricecakes, alumni bands from previous camps, and talented camp volunteers.

## FINAL SHOWCASE
At the end of the camp week, camper bands perform their original songs at a showcase concert for friends, family, and fans!

## FUN ACTIVITIES
At Rock Camp, we know how to have a good time. The camp day is interspersed with fun stuff, from warm-up games to making buttons with your band name.
