## LOCATIONS

**Program Location:** JamStage music complex and practice space is located at 25 Esten Ave. in Pawtucket, RI, less than 5 miles from downtown Providence off of I-95 and close to the RIPTA R Line. Their facility was created specifically for musicians. Each room includes professional musical equipment, as well as the ability to record practices. JamStage also has… you guessed it! A stage! With great lights and a professional sound system! We think you will enjoy your rock experience there quite a bit. For more info visit <a href="http://jamstage.net/" target="_blank">their website</a>.

**Showcase Location:** AS220 Main Stage is located at 115 Empire St. in downtown Providence, RI. <A href="https://as220.org/perform" targe="–blank">Visit AS220's website</A> for more info!

**Accessibility information:**
The entrance to Jamstage has seven stairs outdoors, plus one step up between the lobby entrance and restrooms. There are a few steps up from the stage-space floor to the stage itself. There will be a quiet/chill room available for campers to step away from the noise as needed. AS220's Main Stage performance space has a sidewalk-level entrance and accessible restrooms off the adjacent bar space. There are a few steps up from the venue floor to the stage. We recommend wearing hearing protection during all camp activities, including (and especially) the Showcase. This is a LOUD environment! If you have questions about accessibility for any part of this program, please email us at [info@riotri.org](mailto:info@riotri.org). 

## TUITION

The cost of camp is $395, or $425 with a limited-edition RIOT RENAISSANCE t-shirt or tote bag. All gift registrations are priced to include the limited-edition merch. Payment is needed to complete the registration process. We have a limited number of scholarships available. Please contact us at [info@riotri.org](mailto:info@riotri.org) for more information.

## PAYMENT

Payment can be made in full via check to RIOT RI, P.O. Box 23371, Providence, RI 02903. We can also accept online payments via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/riotrhodeisland" target="_blank">PayPal</a>.

## CAPACITY AND ADMISSIONS POLICY

Space is limited to 30 participants, first come, first served. Please note that while we do our best to help everyone get their first choice instrument, that is not always possible, and sometimes campers will have to play their second choice instrument as a way to make cohesive bands (we don’t have space for a band with seven drummers!).

## ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND CONFIRMATION

We can process your registration as soon as we have received your registration form and payment. We will confirm your enrollment via email as soon as possible after receiving both of these pieces, and no later than two weeks before camp. If spots for your first-choice instrument fill up before your registration reaches us, we will notify you and automatically assign you to your second instrument choice. We will also add you to a waiting list for your first choice. We will announce on our website when enrollment is full and we will cut off registration at that time.

## CANCELLATION POLICY

If you need to cancel, please notify the office right away. If you have submitted your payment and would like a refund, you must cancel IN WRITING via email to [info@girlsrockri.org](mailto:info@girlsrockri.org). If you cancel before December 31, 2024, you will be issued a full refund minus a $50 cancellation fee. However, if you cancel on or after that date (within one month of the start of camp) you will be issued a 50% tuition refund. We are unable to refund cancellations after January 24, 2025.

## ACCOMMODATIONS FOR OUT-OF-TOWNERS

Adult Rock Camp does not provide accommodations for the weekend, but we can help you connect with another rocker if you need a place to stay. Please indicate your request on the registration form, and contact us at [info@girlsrockri.org](mailto:info@girlsrockri.org) with any further questions.

If you live locally and can host a fellow camper from out-of-town, please let us know when you register! YOU ROCK!! 

## SCHEDULE

About two weeks before camp, you will receive a detailed schedule of the weekend. However, you can plan on camp beginning at 11:00am on Friday and ending after the showcase (around 8:30PM) on Sunday. It is an action-packed weekend with long days. 
**Please take these hours into consideration when making travel arrangements and adjusting work schedules.**

RIOT RI does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national and/or ethnic origin, citizenship, marital status, sexual orientation, mental or physical ability, or gender identity/expression in the administration of any of its educational programs, admissions policies, financial aid, and other camp related policies and programs, as well as volunteer and employment-related policies and activities.
