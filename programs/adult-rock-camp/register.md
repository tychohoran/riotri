## LOCATION

JamStage music complex and practice space is located at 25 Esten Ave. in Pawtucket, RI, less than 5 miles from downtown Providence off of I-95. Their facility was created specifically for musicians. Each room includes professional musical equipment, as well as the ability to record practices. JamStage also has… you guessed it! A stage! With great lights and a professional sound system! We think you will enjoy your rock experience there quite a bit. For more info visit [www.jamstage.net](www.jamstage.net).

**Accessibility information:**
The entrance to Jamstage has seven stairs outdoors, plus one step up between the lobby entrance and restrooms. The entrance to our showcase venue may also involve some steps.
There will be a quiet/chill room available for campers to step away from the noise as needed. We recommend wearing hearing protection during camp activities—this is a LOUD environment!
If you have questions about accessibility for any part of this program, please email us at [info@riotri.org](mailto:info@riotri.org). 

## TUITION

The cost of camp is $395, or $425 with a limited-edition RIOT RENAISSANCE t-shirt or tote bag. All gift registrations are priced to include the limited-edition merch. Payment is needed to complete the registration process. We have a limited number of scholarships available. Please contact us at [info@riotri.org](mailto:info@riotri.org) for more information.

## PAYMENT

Payment can be made in full via check to RIOT RI, P.O. Box 23371, Providence, RI 02903. We can also accept online payments via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/riotrhodeisland).

## CAPACITY AND ADMISSIONS POLICY

Space is limited to 30 participants, first come, first served. Please note that while we do our best to help everyone get their first choice instrument, that is not always possible, and sometimes campers will have to play their second choice instrument as a way to make cohesive bands (we don’t have space for a band with seven drummers!).

## ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND CONFIRMATION

We will confirm your enrollment via email as soon as we process your registration and no later than two weeks before camp. If instrument spots fill up before your registration reaches us, we will notify you and automatically assign you to your second instrument choice. We will add you to a waiting list for your first instrument choice. We will announce on our website when enrollment is full and we will cut off registration at that time.

## CANCELLATION POLICY

If you need to cancel, please notify the office right away. If you have submitted your payment and would like a refund, you must cancel IN WRITING via email to [info@girlsrockri.org](mailto:info@girlsrockri.org). If you cancel before December 31, 2024, you will be issued a full refund minus a $50 cancellation fee. However, if you cancel on or after that date (within one month of the start of camp) you will be issued a 50% tuition refund. We are unable to refund cancellations after January 24, 2025.

## ACCOMMODATIONS FOR OUT-OF-TOWNERS

Adult Rock Camp does not provide accommodations for the weekend, but we can help you connect with another rocker if you need a place to stay. Please indicate your request on the registration form, and contact us at [info@girlsrockri.org](mailto:info@girlsrockri.org) with any further questions.

## SCHEDULE

About two weeks before camp, you will receive a detailed schedule of the weekend. However, you can plan on camp beginning at 11:00am on Friday and ending after the showcase (around 8:30PM) on Sunday. It is an action-packed weekend with long days. 
**Please take these hours into consideration when making travel arrangements and adjusting work schedules.**

## NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY

RIOT RI does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national and/or ethnic origin, citizenship, marital status, sexual orientation, mental or physical ability, or gender identity/expression in the administration of any of its educational programs, admissions policies, financial aid, and other camp related policies and programs, as well as volunteer and employment-related policies and activities.

## ADULT ROCK CAMP AS A GIFT

Want to give Adult Rock Camp as a gift? That’s great. We have registration available specifically for you, and we will follow up with you (without spoiling the surprise for your camper). Once you have completed [the form](https://forms.gle/SvAzcLaK6MTWVub18) and submitted payment, your camper’s spot will be held. We will follow up with your camper to have them fill out their full registration form after you give us the okay.

Thank you for your interest in Adult Rock Camp. We look forward to rocking out with you!
