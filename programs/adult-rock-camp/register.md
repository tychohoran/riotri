## LOCATION

JamStage music complex and practice space is located at 25 Esten Ave. in Pawtucket, RI, less than 5 miles from downtown Providence off of I-95. Their facility was created specifically for musicians. Each room includes professional musical equipment, as well as the ability to record practices. JamStage also has… you guessed it! A stage! With great lights and a professional sound system! We think you will enjoy your rock experience there quite a bit. For more info visit [www.jamstage.net](www.jamstage.net).

## TUITION

The cost of camp is $395.00. PAYMENT MUST BE INCLUDED WITH YOUR APPLICATION. You will be able to pay through our website as the last step of the ARC registration. Adult Rock Camp is implemented to generate awareness for RIOT RI, as well as reach out to those who support our mission. Tuition has been set at the absolute lowest amount possible (below our own costs for the program) and meet expected financial goals for our programs. We have a limited number of scholarships available. We also have flexible payment plans available (see below for payment options)! Please contact Co-Executive Director, Rikki Davis at [rikki@riotri.org](mailto:rikki@riotri.org) for more information.

## CAPACITY AND ADMISSIONS POLICY

Space is limited to 30 participants, first come, first served. Given how well our previous camps have gone, we are expecting this one to fill up fast, so register early! Please note that while we do our best to help everyone get their first choice instrument, that is not always possible, and sometimes campers will have to play their second choice instrument as a way to make cohesive bands (we don’t have space for a band with seven drummers!).

## ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND CONFIRMATION

We will confirm your enrollment via email as soon as we process your registration and no later than two weeks before camp. If instrument spots fill up before your registration reaches us, we will notify you and automatically assign you to your second instrument choice. We will add you to a waiting list for your first instrument choice. We will announce on our website when enrollment is full and we will cut off registration at that time.

## CANCELLATION POLICY

If you need to cancel, please notify the office right away. If you have submitted your payment and would like a refund, you must cancel IN WRITING to Rikki at [rikki@girlsrockri.org](mailto:rikki@girlsrockri.org). If you cancel before February 13th, you will be issued a full refund minus a $50 cancellation fee. However, if you cancel on or after February 8th (within one month of the start of camp) you will be issued a 50% tuition refund. We are unable to refund cancellations the same week of camp.

## ACCOMMODATIONS FOR OUT-OF-TOWNERS

Adult Rock Camp does not provide accommodations for the weekend, but we can help you connect with another rocker if you need a place to stay. Please contact Rikki Davis at [rikki@girlsrockri.org](mailto:rikki@girlsrockri.org) for more information.

## SCHEDULE

About two weeks before camp, you will receive a detailed schedule of the weekend. However, you can plan on camp beginning at 11:00am on Friday and ending after the showcase (around 8:30PM) on Sunday. It is an action-packed weekend with long days. 
**Please take these hours into consideration when making travel arrangements and adjusting work schedules.**
