# Instructors

## Rosie Gripton
Rosie (she/her) is a Canadian musician and artist currently residing in Providence, Rhode Island. Her creative pursuits lie at the intersections of punk-rock feminism, D.I.Y, social justice and living everyday with joie de vivre. As an instructor she seeks help her students develop a great breadth of tools to use to express their musical selves. She instructs music in an inclusive, friendly,  and comfortable atmosphere to students from all walks of life, focusing on each student’s individual goals and creative visions.

## Jasmina Gill-Deleon
Jasmina Victoria de Leon Gill (they/them) has been living and working in Providence since 2017, and started working with Girls Rock in the summer of 2019 as a band coach and vocal instructor. They are a trained classical singer, but currently prefer screaming in bratty punk bands such as their band Drooly. Jasmina's goal within music education is to open space to explore vulnerability through vocalization. They work to make music education accessible to people from diverse backgrounds and identities by rejecting western modes of teaching that emphasize theory and discipline, and by instead incorporating conversation, playfulness, and fun. They hope that their classes will help people with marginalized identities become comfortable with using their voices however they want, and move past the shame we are taught to feel around vocal expression.

## Lucy Coykendall
Lucy (she/her) has been involved with GirlsRock! RI for over 4 years. Since beginning, she has been a camper, GRIT, VIT and drum instructor at camp! She began drumming the very first time she participated in Girls Rock Camp. She believes that drumming opens up new pathways to understanding music, and acts as a gateway to learning other instruments as well.  She hopes to aid her students in developing their skills, and guiding them with her personal experience to become fully-fledged drummers.

## Jacqueline James
Jacqui (she/her) is a musician from Rhode Island with a background in multiple genres and styles of music. Whether she is writing in a classical style or for her punk band, it is always through a feminist lens with a focus towards LGBTQIA\+ issues. As a trans woman who has the energy and privilege to be out spoken, she uses her creative platform to try and challenge cis-centric society views. She teaches using accessible language and takes the approach that anyone can learn how to play an instrument.

## Ash Russell
Ash (she/her) is multi-instrumentalist, composer and music educator living and working in Providence since 2016. She is involved in several local projects including the What Cheer? Brigade, Martha Martha Martha and Wolf’s Milk. She began volunteering with Girls Rock! at the first drop-in sessions in 2016, then at the camps, and finally began teaching group bass guitar lessons. She is excited to have the opportunity to help people express themselves. As an instructor, she tries to make the most positive and non-judgemental environment possible.
