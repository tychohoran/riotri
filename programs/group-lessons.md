# Group Lessons Schedule & Class Descriptions

## DRUMS 
* **w/ Reba Mitchell & Intern Leaf B!**
* **Sundays 1:00-2:00pm** 

In this class you will learn how to play beats and fills, and how to put them together to play songs. We will do all sorts of fun, creative activities to develop your skills as a musician and drummer including reading music, listening to music, improvising, writing our own beats, and learning different ways to play with other instruments.

A note about gear: No gear required! You can use our kit during class (though we recommend you have a drum kit, or at least a snare, at home to practice).

## VOCALS 
* **w/ Reba Mitchell & Intern Leaf B!**
* **Sundays 2:30-3:30pm** 

We will explore VOCALS, including good vocal technique, expanding and accessing your range, using your voice as an instrument, basic music theory and literacy, sight singing and ear training, songwriting, turning those conversations in your head into lyrics, harmony and backups, rhythm, getting to know mics, loops and pedals, and so much more!
A note about gear: No gear required!

## BASS 
* **w/ Crikkett Young** 
* **Tuesdays 3:30-4:30pm**

Bass is the place! In this class, you’ll learn the notes, rhythm, scales, and techniques needed to get you started on the bass guitar. You’ll also learn about the important role of the bass in a band. In this class, you’ll learn improvisation as a tool for songwriting, and the basics of music theory too! Popular songs will act as a gateway to all of your own musical inspiration, as you hold down the low end as a brand new bass guitarist.

A note about gear: We ask you to bring your bass to class (Gear Loaned or otherwise), and we will provide an amplifier.

## GUITAR 
* **w/ Ash Russell**
* **Tuesdays 4:45-5:45 pm**

First, we will start at the absolute beginning: you’ll get to know all the parts of the guitar from frets to strings, tuning, healthy playing habits and technique. In addition to learning chords and strumming you’ll also learn about the basic elements of rhythm and lead guitar that will have you jamming out in no time. We’ll also cover the learning of songs, reading tablature and notation for guitar and some helpful introductory music theory concepts! Finally, all of this knowledge will be contextualized by diving into the songwriting process as a group. We will move at a friendly, comfortable pace and ultimately give you more tools to take your guitar to the next level of awesomeness!

## UKULELE 
* **w/ Crikkett Young**
* **Thursdays 3:45-4:45pm**

Want to accompany yourself as a singer songwriter? Want to play music with your friends on a light, portable instrument? In this class, you’ll get to know all the parts of the ukulele, from frets to strings, and then learn some chords and how to strum or finger-pick them! In addition, you’ll also learn about the basic elements of rhythm and lead playing that will have you jamming out in no time. We’ll also learn about reading tablature and notation for the ukulele and some helpful introductory music theory concepts. All of this will be contextualized by diving into the songwriting process as a group. This is a great first instrument to start on, you’ll be shredding in no time!

A note about gear: We ask you to bring your own ukulele to class (GCEA-tuned: soprano, concert, or tenor). Unfortunately, we cannot provide or loan out ukuleles, but we can point you towards some affordable options!

## KEYBOARDS
* **w/ Singer Joy**
* **Thursdays 5:00-6:00pm**

Learning keyboard will keep you from being bored! In this class, we’ll learn keyboard basics, such as one and two-hand technique, notes and scales, major and minor chords, and intro to theory. We’ll learn the foundations of song-writing, so we can express ourselves and write our own!

*A note about gear:* No gear required! You can use our keyboard during class (though we recommend you have a keyboard or piano at home to practice).
