Currently on hiatus, RIOT RI’s Group Lessons program allows you to rock out all year long! Classes are taught by our experienced instructors and typically run in the winter/spring and in the fall. In the past, we have offered group lessons for youth ages 10 to 17 and for adults 18+ in Bass, Drums, Guitar, Keys, Ukulele, and Vocals!

# Group Lessons Class Descriptions

In this class you will learn how to play beats and fills, and how to put them together to play songs. We will do all sorts of fun, creative activities to develop your skills as a musician and drummer including reading music, listening to music, improvising, writing our own beats, and learning different ways to play with other instruments.

## VOCALS 

We will explore VOCALS, including good vocal technique, expanding and accessing your range, using your voice as an instrument, basic music theory and literacy, sight singing and ear training, songwriting, turning those conversations in your head into lyrics, harmony and backups, rhythm, getting to know mics, loops and pedals, and so much more!

You’ll also learn about the important role of the bass in a band. In this class, you’ll learn improvisation as a tool for songwriting, and the basics of music theory too!
