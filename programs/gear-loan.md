We have historically loaned gear to program participants and volunteers year-round for a small deposit, which they get back when the instrument is returned. By offering this service, we have provided access to instruments beyond the program environment and allowed participants to continue to practice at home.

Our Gear Loan program has limited capacity at this time. Please contact [info@riotri.org](mailto:info@riotri.org) if you have gear needs and we will respond as quickly as we can!

Deposit rates vary by type of equipment. Please contact us for details.
