All participants and volunteers are welcome to borrow our music gear year-round for a small deposit, which they get back when the instrument is returned.

Deposit rates are as follows:
* Electric Guitar: $20
* Electric Bass: $20
* Acoustic Guitar: $20
* Keyboard: $20
* Drums: $75
* Practice Guitar Amp: $20
* Performance Guitar Amp: $40

* Performance Bass Amp: $40
* Electric Guitar w/ Practice Amp: $30
* Electric Bass w/ Practice Amp: $30
* Electronic Drum Set: $75

No participant is turned away for lack of funds. If you are not able to put down this deposit, please contact [kai@girlsrockri.org](mailto:kai@girlsrockri.org) with your circumstances, and the deposit fee can be waived. 

All gear loan participants will need to submit a Gear Loan Agreement:
