Deposit rates are as follows:
* Electric Guitar: $20
* Electric Bass: $20
* Acoustic Guitar: $20
* Keyboard: $20
* Drums: $75

No participant is turned away for lack of funds. If you are not able to put down this deposit, please contact [rikki@girlsrockri.org](mailto:rikki@girlsrockri.org) with your circumstances, and the deposit fee can be waived.
