## BECOME A GRIT

Are you a Youth Rock Camp/Girls Rock Camp alum between the ages of 15-18 (heading into grade 10-12 in fall 2020), who has either a) attended Youth Rock Camp/Girls Rock Camp twice or b) attended Youth Rock Camp/Girls Rock Camp once and has also attended another GRR!/RIOT RI program (such as Group Lessons or Sophia Sings)? You’re in luck– you are qualified to be a GRIT (Girls Rock Camp Internship & Training program participant) at Session One of camp (you can still attend Session Two, as well!)! All qualified applications completed by the deadline will be considered. Learn more about becoming a GRIT and fill out the GRIT application below!

Please note: youth who have already participated in the GRIT program in the past are not eligible to apply again this year, in order to give more youth the opportunity. However, GRIT alums can still attend Youth Rock Camp Session 2 as campers and be a part of our VIT (Volunteer-in-Training program– contact Denise at [denise@riotri.org](mailto:denise@riotri.org) for more info about becoming a VIT)!
