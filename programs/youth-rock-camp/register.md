# ABOUT VIRTUAL ROCK CAMP

The session will run from 10/13/2020 - 11/18/2020 on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 5:30-6:30 PM via Zoom

## Who is Eligible to Register?

Campers ages 11 - 18 yrs old are eligible to join. This camp is only for youth who identify as girls, trans, or nonbinary.

## What Does a Virtual Camp Entail?

Each camper will receive instrument instruction via Zoom in either Guitar or Keyboards (they will be provided with an instrument and a learning kit, along with virtual instruction). They will participate in weekly workshops on songwriting, media literacy, and anti-racism. They will also work collaboratively week in the songwriting process with the guidence of a coach. 

Camp will culminate in a Livestreamed Virtual concert for friends, family, and fans!

Instruments available for gear loan and instruction: Guitar or Keyboard. Note: if you have an instrument at home you feel super comfortable playing without much instruction, we are psyched to have you use it to write your original song, but know that for this camp we are only able to offer instruction for guitar and keyboards.

## How Much Does it Cost?

The base cost to attend camp is $200. This includes use of an instrument** and learning package which will be delivered to you (delivery scheduling to follow), three weekly hour-long sessions, and at-home video learning materials. 

Tuition costs are subject to sliding scale based on the needs of your family. If you require financial aid, you will be able to fill out a financial aid section on the application. No camper will be turned away for lack of funds!

## In what format will camp be held

Camp will be run entirely via Zoom.

## How much does camp cost?

Tuition for the 5 weeks of camp is $200 plus a $10 application fee. Please note, application fees and tuition are not considered donations and therefore are not tax-deductible. If you would like to sponsor another camper who cannot afford full tuition you can separately make a donation to our scholarship fund [here](https://www.mightycause.com/organization/Girls-Rock-Rhode-Island).

## Is financial aid available?

Yes. We offer reduced tuition on a sliding scale based on the participant’s household income. No camper is turned away for lack of funds. You will find the financial aid form in the application.

## What is reduced tuition and sliding scale?

We offer reduced tuition on a sliding scale based on annual household income.  Families awarded a Partial Scholarship for reduced tuition will pay what they can based on a predetermined scale. If you receive a scholarship, and you are still unable to afford the program, please contact [denise@riotri.org](mailto:denise@riotri.org) and we can make special arrangements. No camper is turned away for lack of funds.

## How many reduced tuition spots are available?

Space is limited to 20 participants and we will award approximately 7 Full Pay spots, 6 50% Scholarship spots, and 7 80% Scholarship spots. 

## When is the tuition payment due?

Once you have received final confirmation that your camper has been accepted into camp, payment is due by October 10, or two weeks after your acceptance is communicated (whichever comes first). If you do not pay in full by the deadline we will be forced to cancel your acceptance into the camp and give your spot to another camper.

Full pay tuition is $200. If you are receiving a 50% scholarship, tuition is $100. If you are receiving an 80% scholarship, tuition is $40. You will be able to pay on this page via Paypal or via check once we contact you to let you know your camper is on the final camper list.

## What if I am accepted but I don’t get my first choice of instrument?

We do our best to help everyone get their first choice instrument, but that is not always possible, and sometimes campers will have to play their second choice instrument depending on instrument availability and class sizes. 

## When will I know if I got in?

If you apply online we will email you a notification that your registration has been received within one week of the date of your registration.  We will also mail out notifications to every applicant to inform you of the status of your acceptance.  Registration closes on October 5 and the final list of campers will go out by October 9.

## What if I need to cancel?

If you need to cancel, please notify the office right away.  If you have submitted your payment and would like a refund, you must cancel IN WRITING.  If you cancel before October 5 we will refund 50% of your payment.  If you cancel after October 9 we cannot refund your payment.  Also, full payment is due by October 10.  If you have not paid in full by this date, you will lose your spot, as there are many other rockers who’d be happy to have it!

## I didn’t get in, is there a waitlist?

If you didn’t get into this session we will keep a short waitlist in case there are any last-minute cancellations. This list is only active for this year’s sessions and you will have to re-register next year.

## Do you only play “rock” music at Youth Rock Camp?

No! We use “rock” as a verb, as in we like to “rock out” on all kinds of music! Our campers listen to and play a wide range of music genres, from rock to hip-hop, jazz to folk, pop to punk. Our volunteer instructors and band coaches support campers in finding their own voices and creating the kind of music that they are most passionate about.

## Do I have to have musical experience?

Nope, all skill levels are welcomed! Camp is a wonderful opportunity to try new things and learn from each other.

## Is the camp only open to girls? / Are cis boys allowed to register for camp?

The camp is open to girls, trans and nonbinary youth. Our mission is to provide an affirming space that supports your identity. Any camper who self-identifies as a girl, trans, or non-binary person is welcome to attend the camp.

## Safety Concerns:

All instruments will be sanitized before delivery to your home. No other person-to-person contact will be made between staff and campers. Socio-emotional support will be available to all students on-call for the duration of the camp.
