## How much does camp cost?

Tuition for the week is $475 plus a $10 application fee. Please note, application fees and tuition are not considered donations, and therefore are not tax deductible. If you would like to sponsor another camper who cannot afford full tuition you can separately make a donation to our scholarship fund [here](mightycause.com/organization/Riot-Rhode-Island).

## Is financial aid available?

Yes. We offer reduced tuition on a sliding scale based on the participant’s household income. No camper is turned away for lack of funds.

## What is reduced tuition and sliding scale?

We offer reduced tuition on a sliding scale based on annual household income.  Families awarded a Partial Scholarship for reduced tuition will pay what they can based on a predetermined scale. If you receive a scholarship, and you are still unable to afford the program, please contact [rikki@riotri.org](mailto:rikki@riotri.org) and we can make special arrangements. No camper is turned away for lack of funds.

## How many reduced tuition spots are available?

Space at each session is limited to 36 participants and we will award approximately 12 Full Pay spots, 12 50% Scholarship spots, and 12 80% Scholarship spots. 

## When is the tuition payment due?

Once you have received final confirmation that your camper has been accepted into camp, payment is due by May 15 for early acceptance or June 1 for the second round of acceptance letters. If you do not pay in full by the deadline we will be forced to cancel your acceptance into the camp and give your spot to another camper.

Full pay tuition is $475. If you are receiving a 50% scholarship, tuition is $237. If you are receiving an 80% scholarship, tuition is $95. You will be able to pay on this page via Paypal or via check once we contact you to let you know your camper is on the final camper list.

## What if I am accepted but I don’t get my first choice of instrument?

We do our best to help everyone get their first choice instrument, but that is not always possible, and sometimes campers will have to play their second choice instrument as a way to make cohesive bands.

## When will I know if I got in?

If you apply online we will email you a notification that your registration has been received within one week of the date of your registration.  We will also mail out notifications to every applicant to inform you of the status of your acceptance.  Registration closes on June 1, or once all spots have been filled. A waitlist will be available to fill in last-minute spots. 

## What if I need to cancel?

If you need to cancel, please notify the office right away.  If you have submitted your payment and would like a refund, you must cancel IN WRITING.  If you cancel before June 15 we will refund 50% of your payment.  If you cancel after June 15 we cannot refund your payment.  Also, full payment is due by June 1.  If you have not paid in full by this date, you will lose your spot, as there are many other rockers who’d be happy to have it!

## I didn’t get in, is there a waitlist?

If you didn’t get into this session we will keep a short waitlist in case there are any last minute cancellations. This list is only active for this year’s sessions and you will have to re-register next year.

## Do you only play “rock” music at Youth Rock Camp?

No! We use “rock” as a verb, as in we like to “rock out” on all kinds of music! Our campers listen to and play a wide range of music genres, from rock to hip-hop, jazz to folk, pop to punk. Our volunteer instructors and band coaches support campers in finding their own voices and creating the kind of music that they are most passionate about.

## Do I have to have musical experience?

Nope, all skill levels are welcomed! camp is a wonderful opportunity to try new things and learn from each other.

## Can boys attend camp?

The camp is open to girls, trans and nonbinary youth. Our mission is to provide an affirming space that supports your identity. If you identify as a girl, trans, or nonbinary youth, you are welcome at camp!

## Safety Concerns:

RIOT RI is a fully-insured day camp in Rhode Island. All of our camp week volunteers undergo the standard, up-to-date background checks required of anyone working with children in Rhode Island. RIOT RI also provides up to 30 min. of morning & afternoon supervision for campers who cannot be dropped off or picked up right as the camp day begins & ends.

## What are your COVID-19 Policies?

All staff, participants, and volunteers are required to wear masks at all times while indoors in RIOT RI programming (lunch will be eaten outside in a tent!). All participants, staff, and volunteers must have their up to date COVID-19 vaccinations (including booster if eligible), and show a proof of vaccination in order to participate. Rapid testing kits will be provided each day of camp at check-in. All participants must sign our COVID-19 waiver, and agree to honor all COVID-19 policies.
