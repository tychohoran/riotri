## REGISTRATION IS OPEN FOR GROUP LESSONS

This Fall, RIOT RI is offering a variety of group music lesson opportunities for youth and adults — see offerings and schedule below. All lessons will be held at RIOT RI’s Headquarters, located at 763 Rear Westminster Street on the west side of Providence (right across the street from Classical High School) and start the first week of October. Classes run for 10 weeks culminating in a final community concert.
 
Registration is required and is first-come, first-served. **Need-based financial aid and gear loan available.** We welcome girls, women, trans, and gender expansive individuals in our programming. To learn more about our Band Booster program, or other programs [visit our programs page.](/programs/)

**PLEASE READ BEFORE MOVING FORWARD**
Please note that due to COVID safety concerns our group lessons are scaled back to a maximum of 3 participants plus an instructor. Additionally, all in-person programming requires proof of vaccination from participants as well as staff. RIOT RI has a universal mask policy. To read our updated COVID protocols please read this document : [Covid Protocols 2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OnPsn8ASOBeKVkbNZ3ANokCyBRZ178R4OG1BuN06Snk/edit?usp=sharing)

We are also offering a VIRTUAL ONE ON ONE setting (drums, keys, vocals, ukulele, bass, guitar, music theory) for participants who wish to continue learning from home and do not require vaccination --  There is also an option for IN PERSON ONE ON ONE (drums, keys, vocals, ukulele, bass, guitar) for those who work better in this setting - this is also great for those who want to work one on one or go deeper in their learning practice!

# Group Lessons Schedule

## KEYBOARDS
* **w/ Singer Joy**
* **Wednesdays**
* Youth- 3:30-4:30pm
* Adults- 5:00-6:00pm

In this class, we’ll learn keyboard basics, such as one and two-hand technique, notes and scales, major and minor chords, and intro to theory. We’ll learn the foundations of song-writing, so we can express ourselves and write our own!

*A note about gear:* No gear required! You can use our keyboard during class (though we recommend you have a keyboard or piano at home to practice).


## GUITAR 
* **w/ Aloe Russell**
* **Thursdays**
* Youth - 3:30-4:30
* Adults – 5:00 - 6:00


First, we will start at the absolute beginning: you’ll get to know all the parts of the guitar from frets to strings, tuning, healthy playing habits and technique. In addition to learning chords and strumming you’ll also learn about the basic elements of rhythm and lead guitar that will have you jamming out in no time. We’ll also cover the learning of songs, reading tablature and notation for guitar and some helpful introductory music theory concepts! Finally, all of this knowledge will be contextualized by diving into the songwriting process as a group. We will move at a friendly, comfortable pace and ultimately give you more tools to take your guitar to the next level of awesomeness!

A note about gear: We ask you to bring your guitar to class (Gear Loaned or otherwise), and we will provide an amplifier.




## BASS 
* **w/ Ian Lefort (Youth) and Crikkett Young (Adult)** 
* **Mondays**
* Youth - 3:30-4:30
* Adults – 5:00 - 6:00

Bass is the place! In this class, you’ll learn the notes, rhythm, scales, and techniques needed to get you started on the bass guitar. You’ll also learn about the important role of the bass in a band. In this class, you’ll learn improvisation as a tool for songwriting, and the basics of music theory too! Popular songs will act as a gateway to all of your own musical inspiration, as you hold down the low end as a brand new bass guitarist.

A note about gear: We ask you to bring your bass to class (Gear Loaned or otherwise), and we will provide an amplifier.

# Dates and Weather
If there are any cancellations due to weather, instructor illness, or other unforeseen circumstances, we will reschedule the class based on instructor and participant availability. 

# COVID-19 and Switching Virtual
If COVID-19 test-positive rates in our city rise above 5%, we will be shifting all programming to a virtual setting immediately. Classes will continue at their normal times via zoom. Additional information will be distributed if this becomes a necessity. 

# Location

All Group Lessons will be held at RIOT RI’s program and office space: 763 Rear Westminster Street in Providence, RI (across the street from Classical High School).

# Capacity and Admissions

There is limited capacity for each class and registration is first-come, first-served for each tuition category. Registration must include enough paying participants (determined by staff) for class to run. We rely on tuition fees to run this program, which requires a certain minimum of paying students. If registration is low, classes may be cancelled and participants will be contacted by RIOT RI staff.
