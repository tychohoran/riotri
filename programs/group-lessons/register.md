The cost for this 10 week session where you will learn an instrument, write a song, and perform live is $300.00 - As always, no one will be turned away for lack of funds so we are offering a sliding scale tuition cost based on financial need according to self-reported income. If you have special circumstances not reflected in your income, please indicate so in your financial aid application. 

Depending on enrollment, scholarships may be limited and will be offered on a first-come, first-served need basis. BIPOC Students attend RIOT RI Group Lessons at no cost and are encouraged to apply!

# Capacity and Admissions

There is limited capacity for each class and registration is first-come, first-served for each tuition category. Registration must include enough paying participants (determined by staff) for class to run. We rely on tuition fees to run this program, which requires a certain minimum of paying students. If registration is low, classes may be cancelled and participants will be contacted by RIOT RI staff.
