Learning keyboard will keep you from being bored! In this class, we’ll learn keyboard basics, such as one and two-hand technique, notes and scales, major and minor chords, and intro to theory. We’ll learn the foundations of song-writing, so we can express ourselves and write our own!

In addition to learning chords and strumming you’ll also learn about the basic elements of rhythm and lead guitar that will have you jamming out in no time. We’ll also cover the learning of songs, reading tablature and notation for guitar and some helpful introductory music theory concepts! Finally, all of this knowledge will be contextualized by diving into the songwriting process as a group. We will move at a friendly, comfortable pace and ultimately give you more tools to take your guitar to the next level of awesomeness!

*Take intermediate classes if you have done an intro class and want to take your practice to the next level!*
