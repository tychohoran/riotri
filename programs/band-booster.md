Band Booster is a program where bands can learn how to be bands! Bands get a weekly practice time at our space (gear included!) and learn how to practice effectively, record their music, book shows, and promote themselves with the support of their own experienced band coach, who helps them reach their goals. Participants learn to screen print, and create merch for their band!

Girls Rock! RI partners with New Urban Arts, using their recording studio for students to create a final product at the end of the session that they can use to book shows moving forward. They also have the opportunity to take part in a stop-motion animation, music video class. At the end of the session, they showcase their songs for friends and family at a community concert. 

Band booster is free to attend, but students must apply as a group of 2 or more. Some previous experience playing your instrument is recommended, but not required.
