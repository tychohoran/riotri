The Girls Rock Camp Two Final Showcase was, predictably, awesome. But don't take our word for it.

Up first... The Unmasked!

As always, there are plenty more photos from the second showcase in our [Flickr feed](https://www.flickr.com/photos/girlsrockri/albums/72157657198085346).

Thanks to everyone who came out to the show, thanks to all our sponsors who supported us and thanks to all our super volunteers who helped make it all happen!

Until next time... GIRLS ROCK!
