**Name, Age, & Hometown**

Shannon Le Corre, 26, Blacksburg, VA

**Tell us a little bit about yourself and your background with music, education, or social justice work.**

I've been playing music for 10+ years, and started playing with my best friends in high school after we found out about feminism and got really angry at everything so we made music about it! I went to school for women's studies and psychology, and have worked with organizations such as Planned Parenthood and Girls Rock! RI, and most recently for Resources for Human Development (RHD, an art and music day program for adults with disabilities).

**For musicians: Are you currently playing music? If so, tell us about it!**

I play guitar and sing in two bands in Providence: [Gertrude Atherton](https://www.facebook.com/GertrudeAtherton) with some ladies I met volunteering at Girls Rock! RI, we play riffy grunge! My other project is called [Bloodpheasant](https://www.facebook.com/Bloodpheasant), which is self described as "folk doom" whatever that means!

**What are some awesome bands featuring female-identified musicians that you are listening to right now? (include link and short description for each)**

My BFF Dominique is in a great post punk/poppy grunge band in Philly right now called [Blowdryer](https://blowdryer.bandcamp.com/releases). My friends Kyle and Vic are playing in a two piece, super heavy doom band called [Vile Creature](https://vilecreature.bandcamp.com/releases) which is awesome because Vic never played drums before this band started and she totally kills it and then my favorite band of all time right now is [Harris Hawk](https://harrishawk.bandcamp.com/music) from Boston--great friends of mine. Anne is a total guitar inspiration and her voice is so versatile and amazing, and basically every song is the best song I've ever heard--they play here a lot too!

**What is your role at Girls Rock! Rhode Island?**

In the past I've been a band coach, intern, camp coordinator and volunteer coordinator! Currently I am helping Hilary organize our Youth Action Committee and am hopefully band coaching this summer.

**What is your favorite camp or after school moment?**

The first band I ever coached decided to write a song about the unfair body standards placed on women in the media, and the chorus was "life in plastic, is NOT fantastic" I didn't even have anything to do with it, they just totally bonded about feeling badly about themselves because of TV and magazines, and decided to rage out about it in music--it really showed the importance and impact of the organization. These kids really need a safe space to articulate anger, and it usually results in amazing rock and roll!

**Why do you think someone should volunteer for Girls Rock! Rhode Island?**

Because the kids need us, they need people to look up to that are real, caring and creative. We all have a rough time with self esteem and belonging and having a voice in this culture-- most of us didn't have many safe spaces to be ourselves and create without social pressures growing up. The fact that every time I volunteer at the girls or the ladies camp, I see at least one person transform in a matter of days means that whatever we're doing is working, and it makes volunteers feel the same. It's a great place to find the tools for empowerment--there's nothing like it.

**_Thanks, Shannon! Â YOU ROCK!_**
