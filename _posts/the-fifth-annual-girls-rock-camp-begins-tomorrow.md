The fifth annual Girl's Rock Camp begins tomorrow.

By five pm on Monday, over fifty girls will have met one another, picked up instruments, and formed ten bands.

Thirty-five of them have never done this before.

A number of former campers will be documenting camp as it happens - check out [www.girlsrockri.org/category/news/](http://girlsrockri.org/category/news/), or follow GRR! on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/girlsrockri) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/girlsrockri/), to watch it play out.

On Friday, all ten bands will perform the songs they wrote together, at the final showcase at Providence's Fete.

All are invited to attend. In fact, all are encouraged to attend. This event is free of charge an open to the public.
