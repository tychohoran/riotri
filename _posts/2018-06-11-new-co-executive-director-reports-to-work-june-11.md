_FIVE FUN FACTS_

_ONE_ _I learned trumpet, piano, guitar and drums growing up; percussion stuck, and even as an adult, I've participated in and even started drum circles. I began DJing later in life, and I credit some of the rhythmic choices and blends I deliver in that medium to my background as a percussionist._

_TWO_ _I learned to dance salsa in Havana, Cuba in the year 2000. I was on a trip as a sophomore in college, and maybe it was the famous el Malecón (boardwalk/ocean wall) or the magic lots of visitors to Cuba describe, but finally and suddenly the steps clicked, and I've enjoyed dancing to the music and dance genre ever since. As Celia Cruz (from Cuba), the The Queen of Salsa would say, Azucar!!_

_THREE_ _I was on radio for 15 years (2001-2016), and my programming included... 1) international reporting - news, music, interviews and extensive coverage of Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and communities of color in the US and RI;_ _2) Venus Sings Radio where I brought hip hop, soul music, Cape Verdean, Brazilian, and Dominican music, for example, to Voices of Women, a music format show that airs on WRIU, a station broadcast from the University of RI in Kingston; and_ _3) health-related research-sharing and conversation focused on ending helping disparities, achieving health equity, and sharing resources for communities of color and those near or under the poverty line._

_FOUR_ _I speak Spanish, and learned it from neighbors, who became like extended family, while growing up in Providence. After moving to Cranston, I studied Spanish throughout junior and high school, and continued advancing in the language academically and through travel. I'm not perfectly bilingual, but I'm okay!_

_FIVE_ _I've recently begun attempting to delve into songwriting, and so far...I think I'm terrible at it! I'm realizing I might have to return to guitar or piano to help me, but I really want to learn to play the bass! I'm looking forward to settling in, not only to "co-lead" at Girls Rock! Rhode Island, but also to learn and explore new skills and past joys._
