The bands rocked. The music rocked. The guitarists rocked. The drummers rocked. The vocalists rocked. The bassists rocked. The keyboardists rocked.

The Girls Rock! Rhode Island's Girls Rock Camp Final Showcase (session one of two this summer!) ROCKED.

A quick recap: Fifty-four girls spent the week at Girls Rock Camp at the Rhode Island Philharmonic School in East Providence. They formed bands, learned instruments, wrote music, came up with lyrics and... grew so much. Finally, on Friday night, they took to the stage at the Columbus Theatre in Providence to perform their original songs on stage for the first time.

Let's take a look! First up was Danger Zone.

Then came the Fourmal Females, who were formal, indeed!

We couldn't believe it when we got to the final band. Last but not least: Lyrical Vintage.

Wow. We had to stop and take a breath at the end.

Thank you again to everyone who supports Girls Rock, and to all our campers for rocking so hard!

We have a second camp this year from Aug. 10 to Aug. 14 for campers ages 14 to 17. We'll be back at the Columbus Theatre for the second session showcase, and hope to see you there!
