**Name, Age & Hometown**

Alison Nitkiewicz, 24, living in Providence, RI

**Tell us a little bit about yourself and your background with music, education, or social justice work.**

I am an artist and printmaker interested in large-scale installation. I graduated from RISD in 2013 with a degree in Printmaking. While at RISD, I became involved in the art and music community in Providence-- going to shows, helping start a queer art collective, organizing events in town, and making art. The art and music scene here is really inspiring. My own artwork deals with embodiment, queerness and aggressive femininity. You can look at some of it at [www.alisonnitkiewicz.com](www.alisonnitkiewicz.com)! Since June of 2013, I have been a member of the Dirt Palace, a 15 year-old feminist art collective in Olneyville.

**For musicians: Are you currently playing music? If so, tell us about it!**

For a while, my main musical outlet was going to karaoke every week, but that is changing! I am teaching myself how to play synth and have a few projects in the works. I grew up playing music and singing and have been meaning to start playing regularly again for years, and now its finally happening!

**What are some awesome bands featuring female-identified musicians that you are listening to right now?**

[Cocteau Twins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF-hic7hNpk&index=4&list=PLCA639349D656348F) - classic angel goth

[Kelela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q9LcifnTV4&index=8&list=PLAZI4aCJYTWTtLoQicjhACHVj6sgDIz5x) - minimal dreamy r&b

[Diamanda Galas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yc0QKVd1Z8) - "capable of the most unnerving vocal terror"

**What is your role at Girls Rock! Rhode Island?**

I was the 2014 poster artist, so I was responsible for designing the Girls Rock! promotional posters for the year.

**What is your favorite Girls Rock! Rhode Island moment?**

I think I cried about 10 times at the Girls Rock! Showcase! Too many amazing moments to count.

**Why do you think someone should volunteer for Girls Rock! Rhode Island?**

Having mentors is very important, especially when you are a teen/preteen girl growing up in a society that is constantly attacking your sense of self-worth. Girls Rock! volunteers not only teach girls technical skills on how to rock, but create a space where girls can be themselves, learn from each other, and feel empowered and confident, at an age where that sort of environment is rare but SO necessary! Everyone benefits in that type of space!
