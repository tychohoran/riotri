Since Monday, they formed their own bands, they printed their own shirts, and they wrote their own songs.

They performed these songs for each other - and several hundred friends and family - tonight in a spectacular showcase at Aurora Providence.

Throughout the week, they had Q&A with professional musicians, and workshops on everything from gender and political theory to the very practical question of how to book a show.

Congratulations to everyone involved! This week was week one, for high school girls. August’s camp is for middle schoolers. [Make sure you don’t miss the August showcase by signing up for Girls Rock!
