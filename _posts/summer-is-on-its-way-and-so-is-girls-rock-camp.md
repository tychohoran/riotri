We are getting SUPER excited for our 5th annual Girls Rock Camp!  Campers will learn guitar, bass, drums, vocals, or keyboards, join a band, write a song, and perform the song live in front of a super supportive audience... all in just five days!  Registration for campers and volunteers will begin on March 26th!

We will have 50 campers and a handful of GRITs (returning campers, part of our Girls Rock Internship & Training program) on hand along with a boatload of amazing volunteers to make the week run smoothly!  In addition to lessons and band practice, campers will attend workshops on important topics like media literacy and healthy relationships, which will provide context for the self-expression they engage in throughout the week!

Camp will be happening once again at the amazing Rhode Island Philharmonic with the showcase happening on July 18th at the ever-supportive Fete!
