It's that time again... Ladies Rock Camp!

Join us at the **Final Showcase, Sunday, November 10th at [Firehouse 13](http://www.fh13.com/venue/) in Providence** for the debut of 5 brand new bands!

In just three days, 20 women will learn instruments, join bands, and write original songs that they will perform live for YOU!

Get there at 7pm so you don't miss the fun!  Then stay later and dance it out to DJ Sister Squid during the afterparty!

What will the showcase be like?  Probably a little bit [like this](http://vimeo.com/21376920).  You can RSVP on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/254793048004007/), too!

See you there!
