**Name, Age & Hometown**

Ana Mallozzi, 27, Providence/North Kingstown, RI

**Tell us a little bit about yourself and your background with music, education, or social justice work.** 

I started playing music in school with the cello.  When I was in middle school, I started getting into "rock" music and wanted to get a guitar... alas, I was immediately discouraged by hard guitar tabs and not having a band to play with.  I saw Jason Mraz play at Lupos for like, 10 people when I was about 15, and it totally inspired me to be a singer-songwriter.  That let me write songs and eventually find bandmates in high school... the rest is history!

Now I work in the coffee roasting industry, but music has been and always will be an awesome hobby to escape to!  Girls Rock was a way for me to inspire younger girls to keep playing music... all of my best memories of high school are all music related and some of the greatest friends I have I met through music... it's let me travel to Nashville with my best friends and even make friends and have a once in a life time experience when I studied abroad in London (being able to play open mics, meet locals, meeting musicians from other countries, etc.) and I want to encourage younger girls to keep at it-- there is so much in store if you stick with music!

**Are you currently playing music? If so, tell us about it!**

I am currently in a band called The Sugar Honey Iced Tea: 4 ladies with varying instruments and lots of harmonies.  We were all just friends that happened to play instruments and one day thought we should hang out and jam.  We just really ate cupcakes and drank wine the first practice, but eventually got the hang of it.  We've been together for about 4 years now!! We've been called Folk- Dowop, so we'll stick with that.  Check us out on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thesugarhoneyicedtea?fref=ts) page or [website](thesugarhoneyicedteamusic.com).

**What are some awesome bands featuring female-identified musicians that you are listening to right now? (include link and short description for each)**

Currently, I love [Caroline Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A23AS4hC_A0) from Minneapolis.  She was very folky when The Sugar Honey Iced Tea played with them 4 years ago, but now they've totally transformed into this  R&B sexy strong confidant powerhouse band.  Also, the band as a whole is some of the nicest, goofiest people I've met.  I belt out her songs in the car whenever I need a boost of girls power.

Also, [She Keeps Bees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eClQ-H-T9w).  They are from Brooklyn, and the singer Jess is soo friendly and energetic in person, and then she gets on stage and KILLS it.  I definitely look to this band as inspiration for what I'd like to do with music in the future.  Her voice is soul melting.

Lastly, a friend from London named [Lucy Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQTKC968Plw), who I met when I studied there, and she has become super successful!  Really cool to see her grow from playing open mics to going on mega tours!  She also has really cool phrasing and rhythm  of her lyrics.

**What is your role at Girls Rock! Rhode Island?**

Currently, band coach at Girls Rock Camp, and guitar instructor for our group lessons.

**What is your favorite camp or after school moment?**

I think it's always the showcases... more specifically, the moments right before and right after they perform.  Before, everyone is so nervous and we have this moment of rallying together and I love to see them pumping eachother up.  Then they play, obviously rock it, and we have this awesome celebratory moment after!  It's very cool to witness those feelings and be a part of it!

**Why do you think someone should volunteer for Girls Rock! Rhode Island?**

​I really think that it brings you back to that age in a sense.  And also it totally grounds you to be like, "oh wait, stuff is okay in life."  For instance, I get really hung up on writing lyrics, to the point where I just stopped because I thought it was too hard-  but then I watch 12 year old girls write an amazing song about having a Sugar Rush in 15 minutes... it makes me think I should think more like a 12 year old more often!

Basically, it will just make you so happy and fill you with this powerful, giddy, strong energy.  Even if you are doing non music related volunteering it will still affect you, and you'll become addicted to volunteering to escape normal life!

_We say good bye and thanks to Ana, who is moving to Los Angeles this week!  YOU ROCK, ANA!_
