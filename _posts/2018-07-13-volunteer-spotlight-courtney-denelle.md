**Name** Courtney Denelle

**Age** 36

**Hometown** Providence, RI

**Tell us a little bit about yourself and your background with music, education, or social justice work.**

I’m a short fiction writer and grammar nerd for-hire (read: copy editor). I also work with Day One Rhode Island as a Survivor Advocate, speaking out and organizing on behalf of survivors of sexual abuse and sexual assault.

**What are some awesome bands featuring female-identified, trans, or gender non-conforming musicians that you are listening to right now?** 

I have my forever loves—Joni Mitchell (folk), Nina Simone (jazz/blues), Patsy Cline and Dolly Parton (both country), just to name a few. These days, I’m in a deep electronic sort of groove with [St. Vincent](http://ilovestvincent.com/), [Janelle Monae](http://www.jmonae.com/), [Portishead](http://www.portishead.co.uk/) and [The Julie Ruin](http://www.thejulieruin.com/) on heavy rotation. And if [Guerilla Toss](https://guerillatoss.bandcamp.com/), [Ava Luna](https://avaluna.bandcamp.com/) or [Screaming Females](https://screamingfemales.bandcamp.com/) come to town, I’ll be there with bells on!

**What is your role at Girls Rock! Rhode Island?**

I’m a member of the year-round ​Programming Committee, and am a band counselor at camp.

**What is your favorite camp or after school moment?**

There are so many, but one moment stands out among the rest. At the group lesson concert in Spring 2015, there was a young vocalist—maybe 11 or 12 years old—performing with crutches due to a foot injury. She belted out a bone-chilling song about bullying, tossing aside both crutches, holding herself up with the mic stand and screaming (screaming!): DON’T YOU BULLY ME, YOU CAN’T TOUCH ME! Unstoppable.

**Why do you think someone should volunteer for Girls Rock! Rhode Island?**

Whether or not you’re a musician, there is a role for you as a Girls Rock volunteer. The willingness to lend a hand in nurturing this next generation of artists, teachers and leaders has a reverberating effect in the community. It empowers young folks to want more than their known patterns; to want more than what they’re conditioned to expect; to want more expression and constant redefinition in order to meet the needs of the times. And this reverberation goes both ways—it is as much of a learning experience for adult volunteers as it is for campers and students. There is a spectacular immediacy in music creation, and Girls Rock in general. It enables us to find our voice and, most essentially, to use it.
