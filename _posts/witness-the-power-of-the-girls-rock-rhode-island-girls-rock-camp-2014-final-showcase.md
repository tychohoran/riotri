Join us Friday, July 18th at Fete Music in Providence for an epic, life-changing, tear-jerker that you won't want to miss!

Over 5 days, 50 campers form 10 bands, learn instruments, and write original songs. Then, they perform on stage for the first time LIVE for you and hundreds other supportive friends, family, and fans!

It might [sound a little like this](http://bit.ly/16dJluP) and look a little bit like this:
