Our new Volunteer Spotlight is on SARAH CLOVER!

If you'd like to join our amazing volunteer team, you can visit our year-round volunteer page or Girls Rock Camp volunteer page (no musical experience necessary!) to learn more!

**Who are you and tell us a little bit about yourself and your background with music?**

My name is Sarah Clover, I’m 38 years young, from Raleigh, North Carolina. I am an artist and educator with a huge sense of humor. That's what everyone tells me. Art, music and humor are what my life is all about. I learned how to play clarinet in sixth grade but was busy with many other hobbies until college. In high school, I started seeking out lots of different music, which has not changed. In college, I worked as a DJ at our radio station. I saw all the awesome bands that travelled through but was also very interested in the local music scene, which was rocking NC in the early nineties. When I was 22, my friends and I decided to start an all girl metal band called Eves of Destruction. We had little to no experience but we borrowed equipment from friends and started ripping off Slayer and Confessor riffs. We played out and had a lot of fun and frustrations. I am influenced by so many different styles of music. I guess, my top bands of all times, ones I went a little crazy for: The Smiths, Sonic Youth, PJ Harvey, The Melvins, Unwound, among hundreds others. Since arriving in RI 14 years ago to get a MFA at RISD in sculpture, I have continued to play music. Some bands I have played in include: Tastic, Mangrove Mole Medallion, and The Butcherings. I currently playing bass in Cave of Colors, with women I met at GRR!

**What was your role at last year’s Girls Rock Camp?**

I have taught bass and art merchandising (screen printing band logos) at all the camps. I am involved with the Girls Get Loud, our 10 week after school program for middle school students. I also help as Art Merchandise Coordinator, to make sure we have awesome merch like shirts, tote bags, guitar picks, etc. available during our showcases, on our Etsy site, and in local shops.

**What was your favorite camp moment?**

My favorite moment of camp?? I can't really pick one. I guess it’s the look of joy and accomplishment you see in their eyes when they have figured something out and they have a bit more confidence and new supportive band mates. Or when a parent is overwhelmed with happiness and pride seeing their child perform. My other favorite moments at camp are connecting with the other volunteers and everyone having a positive, encouraging attitude. There are too many awesome moments, that’s why I keep doing it.

THANKS, SARAH!  YOU ROCK!!
