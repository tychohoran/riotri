By day three, the campers have settled into their temporary home for the week.

Their hosts at the Rhode Island Philharmonic Music School are very generous, and the campers have been careful to clean up after themselves.

The main recital hall became a dance hall as Bummer, today’s lunch time performers, filled the space with music.

The bass players paraded through the halls during their lesson.

(It was part of an exercise in moving while keeping the beat)

As GRITs have in years before, the Girls Rock Internship Training program team had a photo shoot in the overgrown playground behind the school.

A rehearsal room roared as the guitarists reviewed their growing arsenal of chords.

Next door, there was silence, as a band took a “brain break” to play a game of statues.

The afternoon workshop was for making band merchandise.

Bands made their own buttons, designed their own logos, and screenprinted a set of t-shirts for themselves.

At day’s end, the screenprinting instructor let the GRITs rummage through her collection of shirts from years past.

At the bottom, this GRIT found a treasure: a shirt her first band made, at camp five years ago.
