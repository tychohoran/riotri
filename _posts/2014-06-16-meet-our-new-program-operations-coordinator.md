### WE'RE GROWING!

We are very excited to have Johanna Walczak joining our team as our new Program & Operations Coordinator!  Johanna will be supporting our year round programming, continued participant engagement, and creating systems to make sure GRR! can continue to grow!  If you see her around town or at Girls Rock Camp, give her a welcome high five!

Johanna comes to us with experience in program development, community outreach, and non-profit administration. She served as the Community Building Program Manager for the past five years at Olneyville Housing Corporation, a non-profit community development organization in the Olneyville neighborhood of Providence. In her role there she coordinated the Olneyville Collaborative, a coalition of 20+ neighborhood organizations, and led programs and initiatives to strengthen community cohesion, celebrate the neighborhood's assets, and nurture resident leadership. A graduate of Clark University, she holds a Master's degree in Community Development and Planning. She plays trombone in a 20-piece rowdy brass band, the What Cheer? Brigade. She has also played bass and vocals in various bands and performed in an 18-piece dance troupe. In her spare time she enjoys gardening, biking, the ocean, and obsessing over her three cats.

We're excited to have you on board, Johanna!
