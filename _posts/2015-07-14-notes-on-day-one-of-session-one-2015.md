The first of two sessions began today, this one dedicated to campers aged eleven to thirteen.

Ten new bands formed today:

Rockin’ Robots Explosive Notez The Danger Zone Cherry Blossoms Sunnyside Up Soul Goddess Lyrical Vintage Fourmal Females Faceless Kneesocks …and a five-piece to be named later

After bands were formed, they went straight into band practice, making their first sounds under the guidance of a band coach.

There is a tradition of bands coming to camp to perform and lead conversation with campers. It’s a nice change of pace for a touring band like Heathers, who were in town from Montreal.

Somewhere in there, they also had instrument lessons. This is the sound of eleven girls getting loud.
