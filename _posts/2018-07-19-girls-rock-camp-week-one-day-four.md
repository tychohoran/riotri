It’s been another successful day at Girls Rock! Camp (#girlsrockcamp).

In the morning, campers had instrument lessons and attended a Media Literacy workshop lead by the VITs (Volunteer(s) In Training).

In this workshop, a slideshow was presented, focusing on media in the movies and how it affects our lives.

Then, chosen video clips from _Lord of the Rings, Moana_ and _Wonder Woman_ were watched and analyzed, along with showing a couple advertisements to think about.

Many campers shared their thoughts and comments in an open discussion; boy did they have a lot to say!

For the lunch performance, “FINE.” showed us all how rockin’ they are and answered questions the campers had.

The afternoon workshop was a dancing workshop, where groups got on their feet and choreographed a dance of their own!

And of course, band practice is not forgotten.

Many bands finished their songs or nearly completed them; even after today ends, the excited energy that rose and floated through the practice rooms will linger.
