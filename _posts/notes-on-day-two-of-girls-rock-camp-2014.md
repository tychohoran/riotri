It is always amazing how much campers learn in just a few hours.

A few of the girls in keyboard lessons have had prior experience with the instrument, but for most of them it's their first time playing.

By the end of the second day of camp, these campers had already learned over six different chords and scales.

Not only were they learning new chord progressions, they started writing their own!

Everything that they've done and will do will definitely lead to some fantastic songs.

**GRITs are the Girls Rocking Internship Program**

The GRITs program is in its second year, and is going off without a hitch!

All six new GRITs are have taken camp by storm as they act as in-classroom teaching assistants, equipment organizers, and essentially keep the world of Girls Rock! camp on its axis and rotating.

Somewhat behind the scenes, they are still one of the more mysterious aspects of camp, their absolute awesomeness is hard to capture on camera as they run back and forth between their various responsibilities.

At the end of the day, they did sit still for a few minutes to have their own band practice.

As veteran campers, the GRITs of 2014 have been stellar in their new roles as leaders of camp, creating a even better camp experience than years before!

 

**Scenes from the first two days**

Even better the second time around: sitting down at a piano for only the second time, this Girls Rocker blissfuly played a few chords which she finally grasped.

Hearing the music, this GRIT wrote down her thoughts in the form of lyrics to later use in a song.

Ever thought you can’t play an instrument? Try playing one that’s almost bigger than you. This eleven-year-old picked up a guitar for the first time, the one almost as big as herself, eventually strumming a few chords after learning how to hold a guitar. Embracing all the challenges put forth, all the campers trudge through and face everything with a positive attitude.

Lovely leaders: lovingly leading the young vocalists, this GRIT sings with the campers. Practicing what they preach, they include everyone,work together, and rock out, capturing the essence of Girls Rock.

 

**The Image and Identity Workshop**

Today the girls attended a workshop where they discussed the similarities and differences between one’s “image” and one’s “identity”.

The girls then compared and contrasted someone’s identity and someone’s image.

They watched a clip from the film Beauty and the Beast where Belle was walking through her town, which led to a bigger discussion.
