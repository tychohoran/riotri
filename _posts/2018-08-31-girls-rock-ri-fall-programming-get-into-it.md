Learn the basics of your instrument, write a song with your group, and perform it at our Community Concert! Guitar, bass, drums, vocals, and keyboard lessons will be starting September 24th.

**[YOUTH DROP-IN](http://girlsrockri.org/other-programs/) (11-18, Monday-Thursday 3-4pm)\***

Youth Drop-In is an opportunity to meet up with other youth, play music together, meet new band members, try new instruments, play games, talk about issues relevant to your life, work on homework, or create fun activities in a supportive setting. Youth Drop-In begins September 10th. _Program supported by Newport Festivals Foundation._

**[BAND BOOSTER](http://girlsrockri.org/other-programs/) (11-21, weekly slots)**

Band Booster is a new program where bands can learn how to be bands! Bands get a weekly practice time at our space (gear included!) and learn how to practice effectively, record their music, book shows, and promote themselves with the support of their own band coach. Only three slots available, so get them while they're hot! _Program supported by Newport Festivals Foundation._

**[GENDER DISCUSSION GROUP](http://girlsrockri.org/other-programs/) (14-18, every Monday from 4-5pm)**

Talk it out! Gender Discussion Group is youth-led and co-facilitated, with youth both selecting the topics and leading the conversation!

Learn to facilitate conversations on interesting topics and share your opinions in a supportive space. Gender Discussion Group Begins September 24th.

Article Club is your chance to talk about all those articles you just read on the internet… IN PERSON! An “article” could mean anything from a piece in a newspaper, magazine, or blog, to a journal article, short story, or a book chapter, or basically any media. Don't stress if you miss a week-- this is really about the conversation! [RSVP here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1476904872419489/)!
