What is the Battle of the Patriarchy you ask? It’s basically a Battle of the Bands, Rock Lotto Fundraiser wherein women, trans and gender-expansive adults 18+ are placed into bands and given a fundraising goal. The bands write original music while fundraising online to support their local rock camp, and at the end of 9 weeks, the bands finally play a huge fundraiser show!
Here’s how it works: SIGN UP! No experience on your instrument is necessary, but a bit is helpful! We’ll randomly place you into bands with folks you’ve (ideally) never played with before. GRR! will lend gear to folks that don’t have the instruments that they need, and will provide practice space (up to 2x/month)!
Registration costs $10.00. Registration is on a first-come-first-served basis, we will be forming 10 total bands. To register and complete your registration payment, please follow the links below:
