**Name** Ashley Anderson

**Age** 27

**Hometown** Due to moving around a lot as a child (Germany, Texas, New Mexico), I don't really have a home town, but when I go "home" for the holidays, it's to Tucson, AZ.

**Tell us a little bit about yourself and your background with music, education, or social justice work.**

I've been playing music since I was 7. I started on piano then added flute, bass, guitar, mallets, accordion (the list goes on). When I was in college in Arizona, I became associate director of a non-profit all-ages music venue. I was there almost 5 nights a week for 2 years doing sound, working the door, and running shows. I absolutely loved doing it and it was 100% volunteer work. Girls Rock! Rhode Island has helped me keep giving back to the music community in a different way.

**For musicians: Are you currently playing music? If so, tell us about it!**

I've been playing bass in a noise rock band with two amazing dudes for the past three years. Check us out! [www.goodlord.bandcamp.com](www.goodlord.bandcamp.com)

**What are some awesome bands featuring female-identified musicians that you are listening to right now?** 

[Amadou & Mariam](http://www.amadou-mariam.com) - a couple that met at the Mali Institute for the Young Blind. Mariam does vocals along side Amadou’s guitar and singing. They use a wide array of instruments to create a pretty upbeat, and sometimes haunting tone.

[Beach House](http://www.beachhousebaltimore.com) - another duo. This one hails from Baltimore. Victoria Legrand’s vocals along with dreamy vintage key sounds makes for a good rainy day record.

[Kaia Chesney](http://kaiachesney.com) - Kaia is an acoustic singer songwriter that hails from my “hometown” of Tucson, AZ. She has a beautiful voice and writes songs like a dream.

[Battle of Mice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDYfX5D_O_w) - no longer a band, but Julie Christmas… she has one of the most terrifying voices I’ve ever heard. Battle of Mice was her most recent full-time project and was a sludge metal band. I’d say its good winter music, so get on it.

**What is your role at Girls Rock! Rhode Island?**

This year was my first year at camp. I was a bass instructor and a band coach. When camp, ended, I didn't want to. So now I'm the year round gear coordinator.

**What does the Gear Coordinator role entail?**

It takes a lot of equipment to have a camp with over 50 campers. Someone has got to keep track of all of that gear, and that's me. This involves sorting through all of the equipment we have in our storage, inventorying it, making sure it works, and assisting Johanna with the Gear Loan Program. On that note, if anyone wants to volunteer some time or ideas on how to make our gear organization better, let me know! I’d love the help.

**What is your favorite camp or after school moment?**

This past showcase. All of the campers worked so hard (and had so little time!) to learn an instrument, form a band, write a song, and perform it in front of hundreds of people. It was amazing and incredibly rewarding.

Wooooooo Trouble Tones!!!

**Why do you think someone should volunteer for Girls Rock! Rhode Island?**

Anyone that knows me and was around during the week of camp knows that I wouldn’t stop talking about it. Every day had a new experience and a new challenge to overcome. It was a nice change of pace from my normal job and was so insanely rewarding. I just wish I had volunteered sooner.
