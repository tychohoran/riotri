Girls Rock! Rhode Island is now 5 years old! We have grown as an organization, and we hope you continue to grow with us! This summer, you have the opportunity to join us in helping girls empower themselves though music!  You can do so in a few ways, by applying to become:

- Our new Program and Operations Coordinator!

- A volunteer at Girls Rock Camp!

- A summer college intern!

- A Girls Rock Camp business sponsor!

**PROGRAM and OPERATIONS COORDINATOR!** You can be a part of the GRR! staff year-round! We are hiring for a part-time program and operations coordinator to help us grow our programming and ensure that we have the systems we need to grow on solid ground. [Learn more about this position here](http://girlsrockri.org/join-our-team/)!

**VOLUNTEER at GIRLS ROCK CAMP!** Did you know that spots at Girls Rock Camp fill up in just three days? Did you know that we could fill three Girls Rock Camps and serve three times as many girls, if only we had more volunteers? IT'S TRUE! We have one camp this year, but will be holding two camps next year, and we need as many volunteers as possible to make all of this happen! There are plenty of flexible music and non-music roles available before camp and during camp. Plus, you can volunteer for a few hours or for the whole week!  [Learn more and apply here](http://girlsrockri.org/volunteer/)!
