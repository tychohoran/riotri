**BUY/SWAP OUR GEAR!** Girls Rock! Rhode Island is very lucky. We have a lot of awesome people donate music gear to us! YAY (and thanks!)!

But sometimes, people donate things that we think we'll use (or later discover are non-functioning in some way), and we don't end up using them. After six years, we have a ton of this stuff-- amps/cabs that are too big for us to use, acoustic guitars, miscellaneous electronics, guitars/basses that are too heavy for campers, things that are busted and could be used for parts, etc.! We want to give you the opportunity to buy or trade all this stuff... at a good price, too!

**SELL/SWAP YOUR GEAR!** In addition, we want to give you the opportunity to sell YOUR gear. Have a pile of stuff sitting in the basement that you've been meaning to sell on Craigslist, but you never got around to it? Now's your chance to sell or trade it! Tables at the event for FREE and are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Just bring yr stuff! Set-up starts at 10am.

**DONATE GEAR!** Last, but not least, we still need donations (of OTHER stuff!)! We're currently in need of decent functioning: keyboards, keyboard amps, short scale bass guitars, bass practice amps, DJ equipment, cymbals, electronic drums, electronic music gear, drum machines, gig bags, computers/iPads, handheld recorders, recording mics, recording software, lights, and more! All donations are tax deductible!

Join us, **Sunday, September 27th from 11am-2pm at Machines With Magnets** (400 Main St. in Pawtucket) to get your gear on! You can [RSVP to the event on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/417662928434000/) and if you have questions, contact us at info@girlsrockri.org.
