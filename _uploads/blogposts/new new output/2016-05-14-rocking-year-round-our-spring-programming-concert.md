Girls Rock rocks year-round! We had a great crowd at [AS220](http://as220.org/) on April 30 for our Spring Programming Community Concert, where participants from our youth and adult group lessons performed original songs composed and practiced over the 10-week spring session.

We heard first from **Tuesdays at 6**, from our **adult guitar** class.

Next up: **Guitar Divas**, from our **youth guitar** class.
