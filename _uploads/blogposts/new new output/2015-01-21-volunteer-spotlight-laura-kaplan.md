**Name, Age & Hometown:**

Laura Kaplan, 30, Barrington, RI

**Tell us a little bit about yourself and your background with music, education, or social justice work.**

I have a long history of volunteerism and work in the Human Services, education, and community organization based fields. I love helping with causes that I feel are important and many of them have been arts-related or education-based. I was drawn to Girls Rock when I first heard about it happening in Portland, Oregon and then saw that there was one in Boston, and started to research shortly after that if there was one in Providence. I didn't start getting involved though until after I participated in Ladies Rock camp where I got to live my dream of being on stage as a vocalist in a rock band and wanted to help deliver that experience to others.

Outside of volunteering and Girls Rock, I am focusing a lot on food justice and healthy lifestyles and learning how to become a better educator around these topics.

**For musicians: Are you currently playing music? If so, tell us about it!**

Right now I'm not doing much musically because I'm trying to finally finish my bachelor's degree and I don't have enough time to practice music. I do have some ideas I eventually want to try, like making amplified music out of one of my longest surviving toys from when I was young-- a vintage Muppets Casio keyboard.

**What are some awesome bands featuring female-identified musicians that you are listening to right now?**

I don't listen to much new stuff right now so this will be pretty much a blast from the past:

\-[Shonen Knife](http://www.shonenknife.net/index.html) is forever one of my favorite bands.

\-Bjork's band [The Sugarcubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFQPNApwJGU) I still get a kick out of listening to.

\-Someone said my band at Ladies Rock sounded like Kleenex/Liliput and ever since then I've been a fan of them. [Here is a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm8-3E-mWW0&list=PLf2UdxnGOTgMlSeIwQtnV0Vqoi3V8qfbH&index=5) of my favorite song by them.

**What is your role at Girls Rock! Rhode Island?**

In my own words? I am the person who feeds everyone and fuels the rock. I am also occasionally that person who is telling you to eat or take food home even when you don't want to think about eating food anymore. Also, I take a lot of pride in taking special care and accommodating people who have special dietary needs, such as vegans, vegetarians, gluten free folks, and more. I am a vegan myself, and GRR! is really an awesome place to test out the recipes I create for my food blog, [Banana Curl, Vegan Girl](http://bananacurlvegangirl.com).

**What is your favorite camp or after school moment?**

That's so hard to choose from! I'd say I really enjoyed when my friends from [Like No Udder](http://www.like-no-udder.com/) came to camp last year and helped fuel more rock for campers and volunteers (and keep us cool(er)!)

**Why do you think someone should volunteer for Girls Rock! Rhode Island?**

Because they really do rock! More seriously though, I believe I personally have a duty as a woman to help other women and girls achieve their dreams. Girls Rock was something I would have nearly died to go to as a teen myself, it would have seriously been the coolest thing. So I want to make sure that girls today are able to go and keep being involved with. I am always urging everyone I know to get involved if they can. I feel like it is a life-changing experience for everyone involved.
