Our 4th Annual Girls Rock Camp starts tomorrow and we are SO excited!

Please join us on Friday for the biggest, awesomest, tear-jerkiest event of the year-- the Girls Rock Camp Final Showcase!

Witness empowerment in action as 11 bands of 11-17 year olds form on Monday and perform their brand new original songs for you on Friday!

Hope to see you there for the magic!
