Five women from Girls Rock Boston spent the day with us.

Three of them are in the band Shepherdess, who rocked the lunch hour.

One of their songs was a cover of song that campers had written at one of Boston’s Girls Rock Camps.

They were all electronics whizzes, and they used an rewired telephone receiver as a microphone.

Later, they gave an electronics lesson to the Providence GRITs - the Girls Rock Internship & Training program, for former campers who keep coming back for more.

The day closed with a quick ten-minute dance party.
